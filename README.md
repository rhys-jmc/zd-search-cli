# zd-search-cli

## Getting Started

```
git@github.com:vorks/zd-search-cli.git
cd zd-search-cli
npm install
node ./src/index.js
```

It is also hosted on npm:

```
npm i -g zd-search-cli
```

However, I was unable to get my machine to recognize the command "zd-search-cli". I think this is because in attempts to install a local copy globally, I have messed up npm that I would have to spend some time rectifying. So others may enjoy better luck. Give it a go and let me know how it goes!

## Run Test Suite

```
npm test
```
